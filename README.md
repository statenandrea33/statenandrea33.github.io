# A Bit About Me

My name is Andrea Staten. I am a Senior at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I am currently pursuing a degree in Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIST) with a minor in Political Science. With this degree I am hoping to get a job working for a county or potentially a non-profit to make an impact on environmental issues. I would also enjoy doing beneficial research.
